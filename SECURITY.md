# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

- Email: security@nordapi.com
- Please include:
  - A clear description and impact
  - Steps to reproduce (or a minimal PoC)
  - Affected package/version
  - Any relevant logs (redact secrets/PII)

Please do **not** include private keys, certificates, access tokens, or personal data in your report.

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.

## Supported Versions
Security fixes are provided for the latest released version of this repository/package unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Safe Harbor
We support good-faith security research. If you:
- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Only test against systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Give us a reasonable time to respond before public disclosure

Then we will not pursue legal action related to your research.
